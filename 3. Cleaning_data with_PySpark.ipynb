    "Unlike typical Python variables, Spark Data Frames are immutable. While not strictly required, immutability is often a component of functional programming. We won't go into everything that implies here, but understand that Spark is designed to use immutable objects. Practically, this means Spark Data Frames are defined once and are not modifiable after initialization. If the variable name is reused, the original data is removed (assuming it's not in use elsewhere) and the variable name is reassigned to the new data. While this seems inefficient, it actually allows Spark to share data between all cluster components. It can do so without worry about concurrent data objects."

    "You may be wondering how Spark does this so quickly, especially on large data sets. Spark can do this because of something called lazy processing. Lazy processing in Spark is the idea that very little actually happens until an action is performed. In our previous example, we read a CSV file, added a new column, and deleted another. The trick is that no data was actually read / added / modified, we only updated the instructions (aka, Transformations) for what we wanted Spark to do. This functionality allows Spark to perform the most efficient set of operations to get the desired result. The code example is the same as the previous slide, but with the added count() method call. This classifies as an action in Spark and will process all the transformation operations."

    "## 1. Understanding Parquet\n",
    "Welcome back! As we've seen, Spark can read in text and CSV files. While this gives us access to many data sources, it's not always the most convenient format to work with. Let's take a look at a few problems with CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Difficulties with CSV files\n",
    "Some common issues with CSV files include: The schema is not defined: there are no data types included, nor column names (beyond a header row). Using content containing a comma (or another delimiter) requires escaping. Using the escape character within content requires even further escaping. The available encoding formats are limited depending on the language used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Spark and CSV files\n",
    "In addition to the issues with CSV files in general, Spark has some specific problems processing CSV data. CSV files are quite slow to import and parse. The files cannot be shared between workers during the import process. If no schema is defined, all data must be read before a schema can be inferred. Spark has feature known as predicate pushdown. Basically, this is the idea of ordering tasks to do the least amount of work. Filtering data prior to processing is one of the primary optimizations of predicate pushdown. This drastically reduces the amount of information that must be processed in large data sets. Unfortunately, you cannot filter the CSV data via predicate pushdown. Finally, Spark processes are often multi-step and may utilize an intermediate file representation. These representations allow data to be used later without regenerating the data from source. Using CSV would instead require a significant amount of extra work defining schemas, encoding formats, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. The Parquet Format\n",
    "Parquet is a compressed columnar data format developed for use in any Hadoop based system. This includes Spark, Hadoop, Apache Impala, and so forth. The Parquet format is structured with data accessible in chunks, allowing efficient read / write operations without processing the entire file. This structured format supports Spark's predicate pushdown functionality, providing significant performance improvement. Finally, Parquet files automatically include schema information and handle data encoding. This is perfect for intermediary or on-disk representation of processed data. Note that Parquet files are a binary file format and can only be used with the proper tools. This is in contrast to CSV files which can be edited with any text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Working with Parquet\n",
    "Interacting with Parquet files is very straightforward. To read a parquet file into a Data Frame, you have two options. The first is using the `spark.read.format` method we've seen previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) `df=spark.read.format('parquet').load('filename.parquet')`<br>\n",
    "2) `df=spark.read.parquet('filename.parquet')` \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the shortcut version is the easiest to use but you can use them interchangeably. Writing parquet files is similar, using either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) `df.write.format('parquet').save('filename.parquet')` or <br>\n",
    "2) `df.write.parquet('filename.parquet')` \n",

    "## 6. Parquet and SQL\n",
    "Parquet files have various uses within Spark. We've discussed using them as an intermediate data format, but they also are perfect for performing SQL operations. To perform a SQL query against a Parquet file, we first need to create a Data Frame via the spark.read.parquet method. Once we have the Data Frame, we can use the `createOrReplaceTempView()` method to add an alias of the Parquet data as a SQL table. Finally, we run our query using normal SQL syntax and the spark.sql method. In this case, we're looking for all flights with a duration under 100 minutes. Because we're using Parquet as the backing store, we get all the performance benefits we've discussed previously (primarily defined schemas and the available use of predicate pushdown)."

This gives Spark more flexibility in accessing the data and often drastically improves performance on large datasets.\n",

Depending on the later transformations requested, the cache may not do anything to help performance. If a data set does not stay cached in memory, it may be persisted to disk. Depending on the disk configuration of a Spark cluster, this may not be a large performance improvement. If you're reading from a local network resource and have slow local disk I/O, it may be better to avoid caching the objects. Finally, the lifetime of a cached object is not guaranteed. Spark handles regenerating DataFrames for you automatically, but this can cause delays in processing."
